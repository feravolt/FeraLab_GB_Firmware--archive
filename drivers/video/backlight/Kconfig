	  This framework adds support for low-level control of LCD.
	  Some framebuffer devices connect to platform-specific LCD modules
	  in order to have a platform-specific way to control the flat panel
	  (contrast and applying power to the LCD (not to the backlight!)).

	  To have support for your specific LCD panel you will have to
	  select the proper drivers which depend on this option.
